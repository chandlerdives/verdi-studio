                <dt>How much do you quote for a website?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Every project is unique so we like to keep our prices as flexible as we can in order to meet our client's individual needs. To keep things simple, we classify projects as small, medium and large. Small being a simple, one page website and large being a 5-6+ page site with a blog or shop. Our prices can range anywhere from £700 - £2,200+. For a more bespoke quote, please get in touch by emailing a little bit about what you're looking for and we'll tailor it to your needs.</p>

                <dt>What's included in a package?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Each and every website we create is fully custom-coded to our client's specific needs, but all of our packages include: 
                        <li>~ Client Welcome Pack with results of questionnaire and contract</li>
                        <li>~ Page wireframe designs and moodboards ahead of the website build.</li>
                        <li>~ Website designed with UI/UX principles (eg. mobile friendy, SEO keywords) and with accessibility in mind (eg. colour contrasting checks)</li>
                        <li>~ A tutorial on how you can make simple changes and edits to your site using the Content Management System</li>
                        <li>~ Ongoing support from Verdi Studio</li>
                    </p> 
                </dd>
    
                <dt>Who is responsible for the website after it's built?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>We use a beginning-friendly content management system to make it as easy as possible for clients to edit copy or to add and change out photos on their own websites and/or blogs. We always hand over our websites with a tutorial on how to use the CMS. However, some clients prefer to provide us with the content and for us to fill it all in during the build; and then get in touch for small changes afterwards. We are happy to do these changes for a small fee.</p>
                    <p>Verdi Studio will always keep 2 copies of your website in our own files ~ so in addition to the one in the cloud, we'll also have it on our own hard drives as a back up.</p>
                </dd>

                <dt>Do you offer a payment plan?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Payment is staggered across three stages to make life easier for us both, which generally looks like this: 50% payment upfront, 25% after wireframe approval and then the final 25% when the website is finished and ready to go live. If you would prefer a more bespoke payment stagger, we can absolutely cater for this ~ please get in touch and we'll come up with something together.</p> 
                </dd>
                
                <dt>How much input do I have in the process?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>We see this process as a collobarative experience every step of the way. From the very beginning, our in-depth client questionnaire (sent to you after an intial enquiry email from you) is designed for us to learn all about your business and new website goals. We will then set up a pinterest board for us both to pin design ideas or design visions onto in the run up to the design and build weeks.</p> 
                </dd> 

                <dt>Who writes the content for my site?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>It usually goes one or two ways ~ if the client would prefer us to input the copy as we build the site, we usually send a wireframe a bit earlier than planned (so they can see where text would go) and they use that as a guide. We then require for the copy to be sent to us during the build week(s), so we can imput before editing week.</p>
                    <p>The other way it often goes is for us to use filler text during the website build and for the client to take over and edit it later on.</p>
                    <p>Either way, although we can certainly input pre-written copy for you we don't currently offer a copywriting service.</p>  
                </dd> 

                <dt>How will we communicate throughout the process?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>To ensure the project flows as smoothly as possible, we'll keep our communication to two platforms ~ email for general progress updates and WhatsApp for back and forth messages. We find it's easier for us all to gather and keep track of detailed feedback this way! However there will be a couple of opportunities to a phone or zoom call if this is your preferred way of communicating.</p> 
                </dd> 


                <dt>Do I have to be local to work with you?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Not necessarily ~ We work with clients worldwide, which is just one of the things we love about our job! But if it's useful for you to know: we are primarily based in Europe and work on either the GMT +1 or GMT +2 timezone. </p>
