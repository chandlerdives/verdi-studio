            <h1>~ Bespoke web design and development for the wildest dreamers ~</h1>
            <p>Here at Verdi Studio, we are first and foremost: storytellers. There's nothing we love more than swapping tales over a glass of something sweet (usually a hot chocolate, but sometimes a cocktail).</p>
            <p> That's why we're passionate about partnering with <i>small businesses and creatives</i> to help weave the threads of their tale together into thoughtfully designed <i>custom-coded websites</i>. Just like you, they're one of a kind.</p>

            <p>We'll send a message back with a little bit more about us, a quote for your consideration and a guide to what usually happens next!</p>

            <p data-aos="fade-in">This is what we refer to as the design stage and where we want to really discover what you're all about! You'll book a 3 week time slot on my calendar (this is when all of the magic comes together) and in the meantime complete a website design questionnaire to help us narrow down your design aesthetics. We kindly request that you start collecting imagery and copy that you'd like to include on the site too, ready for the final stage.</p>

            <p data-aos="fade-in">This is the most exciting part ~ designing and building your website! This process is the 3 week magic, starting with finalising the colour palette, moodboard, font choices and wireframe in the first few days. Once you give the green light we will design and build your website, using imagery and copy you have already provided. In the final week you'll have access to the site and we will start revisions for the next few days. Finally, it will be time for us to hand you the keys!</p>
