            <p>Our clients deserve our <i>full, undivided attention</i>; which is why Verdi Studio focuses on just one project at a time within a three-week-build.</p>
            <p>We know first hand that your own business is an extension of your heart, soul and passion. That's why we see this as a collaborative experience and include our clients in our work every single step of the way.</p>

            <h2>It all starts with a story...</h2>
            <p>If you're curious about working with us, all we ask for is a <a href="">simple email enquiry</a> from you, telling us about your business and what kind of website you're looking for. You can even send us design inspiration, if you'd like! Based on this we can send you an initial quote, and if we choose to go forward from here: the real fun begins!</p>

            <p>Once we've agreed to work together, our clients use our Google Calendar to book their three-week-build slot. We work together beforehand on prep work, such as collaborating on moodboards and design inspirations, but it's during this time slot that the magic happens.</p>

                    <p>Every project is unique so we like to keep our prices as flexible as we can in order to meet our client's individual needs. To keep things simple, we classify projects as small, medium and large. Small being a simple, one page website and large being a 5-6+ page site with a blog or shop. Our prices can range anywhere from £700 - £2,200+. For a more bespoke quote, please get in touch by emailing a little bit about what you're looking for and we'll tailor it to your needs.</p>

                    <p>Each and every website we create is fully custom-coded to our client's specific needs, but all of our packages include: 
                        <li>~ Client Welcome Pack with results of questionnaire and contract</li>
                        <li>~ Page wireframe designs and moodboards ahead of the website build.</li>
                        <li>~ Website designed with UI/UX principles (eg. mobile friendy) and with accessibility in mind (eg. colour contrasting checks)</li>
                        <li>~ A tutorial on how you can make simple changes and edits to your site using the Content Management System</li>
                        <li>~ Ongoing support from Verdi Studio</li>

                <dt>Who is responsible for the website after it's built?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>We use a beginning-friendly content management system to make it as easy as possible for clients to edit copy or to add and change out photos on their own websites and/or blogs. We always hand over our websites with a tutorial on how to use the CMS. However, some clients prefer to provide us with the content and for us to fill it all in during the build; and then get in touch for small changes afterwards. We are happy to do these changes for a small fee.</p>
                    <p>Verdi Studio will always keep 2 copies of your website in our own files - so in addition to the one in the cloud, we'll also have it on our own hard drives as a back up.</p>

                    <p>We see this process as a fully collobarative experience every step of the way. From the beginning, our client questionnaire is designed for us to learn all about your business and new website goals.</p>
