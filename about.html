            <p>Chandler's story began in the world of marketing and PR, but a love for weaving narratives and the collaborative spirit of small teams soon led her to the world of web design. A life-altering adventure exploring Australia in a trusty VW Caravelle became the catalyst for honing her coding skills. It was there, amidst the vast landscapes, that the seed of The Verdi Collective was sown.</p>
            <p>The Verdi Collective, a name echoing the spirit of creativity and collaboration, is a female-led haven where we specialize in crafting beautiful and strategic websites for independent and creative businesses like yours.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-5 padded-2 txtleft" data-aos="fade-in">
            <p>We are dreamers, storytellers and adventurers at heart who simply adore connecting with folks who share the fire - the passion for something truly special. That's why we enjoy projects where we collaborate closely, ensuring your website becomes a vibrant tapestry woven with your values and aspirations.</p>
            <p>Speaking of journeys, where is Chandler now, you ask? Well, she's currently traversing Europe in a self-converted campervan (bigger than the last one!) - always on the search for new experiences! But fear not, her passion for listening and that infectious enthusiasm for your fiery ideas remain firmly in tow.</p>
