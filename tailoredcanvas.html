                   <p>Dreaming of a custom website, but the price tag gives you pause? Our Tailored Canvas designs bridges the gap. You get the beauty and functionality of a bespoke site, without the hefty price.</p>
                   <p> We offer stunning, pre-designed themes that are customizable to suit you and your brand. Think of it as "semi-bespoke" - tailored to your needs without starting from scratch. Plus, we keep things fresh by introducing new designs once one is sold!</p>

               <dd>
                   <p>The timeline depends on both how quickly you can provide your prep work (branding, images, copy) and my current project schedule.</p>
                   <p>Here's our top tip: Once you've chosen your Tailored Canvas design, explore the demo to understand the layout and see what kind of content you'll need.</p>
                   <p>To ensure your website receives my full focus, I work on one project at a time. To reserve your slot and get started, simply contact us! Once we receive your prep work and complete any necessary site reviews, your website can be up and running in within one to two weeks!</p>

                   <p>You can choose your own comfort level. The Verdi Collective hosts websites on a beginner-friendly CMS system, allowing you to easily edit text or swap photos yourself. However, some clients prefer us to handle all content after the build process. We're happy to accommodate either option!</p>
                   <p>Additionally, The Verdi Collective maintains two backups of your website: one in the cloud and another on our local drives. Rest assured, your website is always secure.</p>

               <dd>
                   <p>At The Verdi Collective, we believe building your website should be a collaborative journey. From the very beginning, you'll receive an in-depth questionnaire (sent after your initial inquiry) to help us understand your business and website goals.</p>
                   <p>Throughout the process, we'll keep you informed with regular updates, providing opportunities for feedback at every stage. This collaborative approach ensures we create a website that perfectly reflects your brand and empowers you to achieve your online goals!</p>

                   <li>Upfront Payment: Pay for your entire project at once and receive a 10% discount.</li>
                   <li>Staggered Payments: Spread the cost out over multiple installments. We require the first payment upfront before design begins.</li>
