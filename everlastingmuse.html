               <dt>Is this fully custom work?</dt>
               <dd>
                   <p>Of course! We thrive on creating unique designs that capture your brand story. Because your business deserves its own spotlight!</p> 
                   <p>However, it's important for us to note that we don't currently offer full branding services, copywriting, or domain name purchase, though we'd be happy to help you find the perfect domain name for your online presence. Domain names typically require yearly renewals, and we believe it's important for you to have direct control over this aspect of your website.</p>

               <dt>Who's responsible for the website after its built?</dt>

                   <p>You can choose your own comfort level. The Verdi Collective hosts websites on a beginner-friendly CMS system, allowing you to easily edit text or swap photos yourself. However, some clients prefer us to handle all content during the build process. We're happy to accommodate either option!</p>
                   <p>Additionally, The Verdi Collective maintains two backups of your website: one in the cloud and another on our local drives. Rest assured, your website is always secure.</p>

                   <li>Upfront Payment: Pay for your entire project at once and receive a 10% discount.</li>
                   <li>Staggered Payments: Spread the cost out over multiple installments. We require the first payment upfront before design begins.</li>
                   <p>No matter which option you choose, you'll receive the same exceptional service and beautiful website.</p>

               <dt>How much input do I have in the process?</dt>
               <dd>
                   <p>At The Verdi Collective, we believe building your website should be a collaborative journey. From the very beginning, you'll receive an in-depth questionnaire (sent after your initial inquiry) to help us understand your business and website goals.</p>
                   <p>We then take things a step further by creating a shared Pinterest board. This interactive tool allows both of us to pin design ideas and solidify your vision for the website.</p>
                   <p>Throughout the design process, we'll keep you informed with regular updates, providing opportunities for feedback at every stage. This collaborative approach ensures we create a website that perfectly reflects your brand and empowers you to achieve your online goals!</p>

               <dt>What if I'm not sure what I need?</dt>
               <dd>
                   <p>That's what we're here for! One of the biggest benefits of working with us is brainstorming together (We're brimming with creative ideas too!). So please don't hesitate to reach out and chat - we'll help you refine your vision and identify what matters most for your website</p>
