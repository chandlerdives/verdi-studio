            <p>We know first hand that your own business is an extension of your heart, soul and passion. That's why we see this as a collaborative experience and include our clients in our work every single step of the way.</p>

            <p>During our first week together, we will come up with final designs and lock in wireframes for all pages of your site. </p>

            <p>Verdi Studio will start turning the designs into a fully working website. You’ll recieve sneak peeks along the way, with a big reveal just before the weekend.</p>

            <p>We like to refer to this as “finishing touches” week. We’ll implement changes and edits along the way before handing over the keys at the end of the week. </p>

            <h1>We create long-lasting designs that make a impact.</h1>
            <p>When it comes to design, we are inspired by those around us; whether it be people, architecture or the natural world. We lean towards timeless, understated designs but have been known to dabble in the unexpected too.
            </p>
            <p>We recognise that our websites have one main purpose: which is to showcase <i>your</i> business and to tell <i>your</i> stories. Therefore, as long as we create something that truly reflects who you are, we'll feel like we've done our job.</p>
