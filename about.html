            <h2>About The Founder</h2>
            <p> Hello, my name is Chandler and I am the founder and lead designer behind Verdi Studio. I started with a background of Marketing/Press and PR, and then I found myself as a Web Assistant for an independent mini-department store for a couple of years. It was here that I discovered a love of being a part of a small team who have a passion for originality and for sharing stories behind the brands.</p>
            <p>I'm big fan of exploring the world, and in 2019 I took a career break to travel Australia for a couple of years with my other half, during which time we lived in a small VW Caravelle. Over the years I learnt how to code and discovered a new way of combining all my passions into one... And the concept of Verdi Studio was born.</p>
            <p>A couple of years, a change of country and a new (bigger!) campervan later, here I am. You should know that, I love listening above all else and I especially love when people are fired up about something they are passionate about... I can't wait to work together!</p>
